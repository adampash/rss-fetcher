# RSS Fetcher

This is a simple implementation of a Google Chrome extension, made in conjunction with [this guide I wrote on Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5857721/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension).

Chrome's extenion API has changed since I wrote this, so I'm happy to accept pull requests for any updates that need to be made to the code.
